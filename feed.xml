                <p>📢 Dear Karavel users,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. Today, I have an important announcement to share with you regarding the future of Karavel, the navigation library for Jetpack Compose applications.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the development and maintenance of Karavel. Our team consists of only one person, and with the increasing demands of managing our other applications, AppOutlet and GameOutlet, it has become challenging to allocate the necessary resources to maintain Karavel effectively.</p>
<p>We understand that this news may come as a disappointment to many of you who have come to rely on Karavel for your Jetpack Compose projects. However, we believe it's crucial to prioritize the quality and sustainability of our existing applications.</p>
<p>But fret not! We have some excellent alternatives to recommend, which are well-maintained and more mature: Voyager (<a href="https://voyager.adriel.cafe/" target="_new">https://voyager.adriel.cafe/</a>) and Decompose (<a href="https://arkivanov.github.io/Decompose/" target="_new">https://arkivanov.github.io/Decompose/</a>). These libraries offer robust navigation solutions for Jetpack Compose applications and are backed by dedicated teams committed to their continued development.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and for being a part of our journey. We remain dedicated to delivering exceptional experiences with our other applications, and we are excited to see what you will create with Voyager or Decompose. Should you have any questions or need assistance during the transition, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>Wishing you continued success and happy coding!</p>
<p>Best regards, Messias Junior from AppOutlet team</p>

                <p>This week we released version 1.1.3 with improvements in the game screen and a new feature "Wishlist".</p>
<h2>The game details screen</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.04.16.png" alt="" width="968" height="802" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.04.16-xs.png 300w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.04.16-sm.png 480w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.04.16-md.png 768w"></figure>
<p>There is some visual changes:</p>
<ul>
<li class="align-left">Now we have a toolbar with the "navigation back" icon, the game title and a option to add this game to de favories. This last part works with the new feature. "Wishlist"</li>
<li class="align-left">The deals list is more clean and shows the "FREE" label when the game is free</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wishlist</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.07.58.png" alt="" width="968" height="802" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.07.58-xs.png 300w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.07.58-sm.png 480w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2023-05-29-at-10.07.58-md.png 768w"></figure>
<p>We are introducing the wishlist in this release. A screen where the user can see its favorite games. </p>
<h2>Windows support</h2>
<p>After some time of investigation, I finally was able to find the problem that prevents us from running a release version of GameOutlet in Windows hosts. The issues were already solved and we have a usable Windows version.</p>
<p>We also applied a change to make the Windows title bar integrated into the application background.</p>

                <p>In this version we mainly released some theme and snaps support improvements.</p>
<h2>System theme</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.08.36.png" alt="" width="1316" height="926" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.08.36-xs.png 300w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.08.36-sm.png 480w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.08.36-md.png 768w"></figure>
<p>Now, you can select the system theme on the theme list. This way, we can detect whether you are using a light or dark theme and show you the one that fits it.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="703" height="394" style="width: 703px; height: 394px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9rMz9A1Qrkw" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<h2>Snaps are back in town!</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.47.31.png" alt="" width="2624" height="1654" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.47.31-xs.png 300w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.47.31-sm.png 480w ,https://appoutlet.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2022-05-16-at-11.47.31-md.png 768w"></figure>
<p>We solved the snap indexing issue that we had an you are already are able to find any snap on App Outlet!</p>
<h2>Minor improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now we are caching the snaps data after the search</li>
<li>The links from patreon and open collective were replaced by the Ko-fi one</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/app-outlet/app-outlet/releases/tag/v2.1.0" title="App Outlet 2.1.0 changelog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p>App Outlet is an application store for Linux distributions focused on delivering applications released in distro-agnostic packages (snap, flatpak, AppImage). That's why the “universal” is in the subtitle.</p>
<h1 id="3017" class="ku kv il bo kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">The old and the new Linux packaging style</h1>
<p id="89e7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ls kb kc kd lt kf kg kh lu kj kk kl lv kn ko kp lw kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">Before the creation of the distro-agnostic packages, there were two main pre-compiled packages that were distributed over their respective distros: <code class="lx ly lz ma mb b">.deb</code> to Debian and their based distros and <code class="lx ly lz ma mb b">.rpm</code> to the Red Rat Enterprise Linux (a.k.a RHEL) and its derivates.</p>
<p id="dda0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">This architecture could cause some instability problems given the way that the dependencies are managed. Installing software that has a specific dependency could break another or the entire system depending on the size of the change.</p>
<p id="dba9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">These new software packaging tools aim to solve this problem by bringing a more “self-contained” approach. The application's dependencies are already bundled to the deliverable, mitigating the risk of dependencies crashes.</p>
<p id="ce38" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">Besides that, these new packages provide mode features regarding security like sandboxing, permissions management.</p>
<h1 id="8319" class="ku kv il bo kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s not all flowers</h1>
<p id="e172" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ls kb kc kd lt kf kg kh lu kj kk kl lv kn ko kp lw kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">Like every new stuff, the new packages bring some issues: Startup time, theme integration and decentralized distribution (the problem that we will try to solve today).</p>
<p id="9471" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">Each package type has its own way to distribute the application, its own store. Flatpak has the <a class="au mc" href="https://flathub.org/home" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. Snap has the <a class="au mc" href="https://snapcraft.io/store" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Snapstore</a>. AppImage doesn’t even have an installation tool or a formal store but there are some independent distributors like <a class="au mc" href="https://www.appimagehub.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AppImageHub.com</a> and <a class="au mc" href="https://appimage.github.io/apps/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">appimage.github.io</a>. So every time you need to search for new software to install you need to go to several sites, download the package and then install it on your machine.</p>
<p id="4236" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">Some distros have integrations on their own application stores but the distros have preferences of a specific package and don't provide an easy way to get the counterpart.</p>
<p id="0d67" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jw jx il jy b jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ie gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">That’s why the App Outlet was created.</p>
<h1 id="4e75" class="ku kv il bo kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr gm" data-selectable-paragraph="">App Outlet to the rescue</h1>
<p>App outlet fetch data from the Snapstore, Flathub and appimage.github.io, show the applications in a user-friendly way and provide an easy way to install and remove your favourite applications!</p>
